title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Controlling code chunks

By default, if you enter a code chunk, R will output the code that was used to create the chunk and any output that would show up in the console. For example, if I want to load some packages...

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
```
The output can be both annoying and unnecessary. You can control the output of any given code chunk by adding options to the chunk. You can ensure that only the output is displayed:

```{r, echo=F}
require(raster)
```

Or you can suppress errors, warnings, and messages:

```{r, warning=F, error=F, message=F}
require(raster)
```


Or you can specify simply to ignore this particular code chunk in the output:
```{r, echo=F}
7 + 8
```


# Inline code

Note how I am alternating between text and chunks of code to integrate my analyses with my descriptions. You can also create inline code by doing this `r 7 + 8` and the output will contain the results of your function.


# Text formatting

Headers are controlled with hashtag symbols

# One hashtag
## Two hashtags
### Three hashtags... etc.

*You can use one asterisk at the beginning and end of the sentence to create text in italics*

**Or two of them to create bold text**

* You can create a non-numbered list of items
  * using indented asterisks
  * but only at the beginning, not at the end of the line.

You can also create numbered lists

1. using numbers
2. with periods.

# Tables and figures

Figures are easy, as shown above. Just add a code chunk and run your plot() or ggplot() function.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

You can also create simple tables, although I find it a little tedious.

Column header 1   |Column header 2
------------------|----------------
Cell 1.1 value    |Cell 1.2 value
Cell 2.1 value    |Cell 2.2 value

Instead, I would suggest finding an R package that you like for creating tables, and stick with it. That way you can just embed your code for making a table right in the text as well. See these links for a bunch of options:
